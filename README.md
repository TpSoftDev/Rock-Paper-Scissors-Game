# Tic Tac Toe

## Description

This program is a simple command-line Rock Paper Scissors game. The user inputs their choice of rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects its choice. The game then determines the winner based on standard rules.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. Enter your choice:
   - `R` for Rock
   - `P` for Paper
   - `S` for Scissors
3. The program displays the computer's choice and the result.

## Techniques and Skills Used

- **User Input and Output:**
  - Capturing user input using `input()`.
  - Displaying messages and results using `print()`.
- **Random Choice Generation:**
  - Using `random.choice()` to simulate the computer's selection.
- **Conditional Logic:**
  - Implementing `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to determine game outcomes.
- **Function Design:**
  - Writing modular code with functions (`play()` and `is_win()`) for clarity and reusability.
  - Defining helper functions to manage game logic.
- **Code Documentation:**
  - Adding docstrings to functions for clear documentation.
  - Using inline comments to explain key parts of the code.
- **PEP 8 Compliance:**
  - Adhering to Python's PEP 8 style guide for consistent and readable code.
- **Main Guard:**
  - Ensuring proper script execution with `if __name__ == "__main__":`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
Enjoy the game!
